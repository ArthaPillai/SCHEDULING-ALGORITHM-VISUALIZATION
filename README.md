# Virtual Lab for Scheduling Algorithms

Welcome to the project description for the Virtual Lab for Scheduling Algorithms. As a Faculty Research Assistant, I worked on this project from June 2021 to August 2021. The project involved creating a virtual lab to aid faculty with scheduling processes in an operating system by automating various scheduling algorithms. The virtual lab was built using C++, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a virtual lab that could help faculty and students learn and understand scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The lab was designed to automate various scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First-Come, First-Serve), Round Robin, and others. The virtual lab would help reduce manual work time and provide a more efficient and streamlined process for scheduling tasks.

##Technologies Used

The virtual lab was built using C++, JavaScript, and CSS. C++ was used for the implementation of the scheduling algorithms, while JavaScript and CSS were used for the frontend design of the lab.

##Project Deliverables

The following deliverables were achieved during the course of the project:

Implementation of scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, and others using C++
Development of a virtual lab that could simulate scheduling processes
Integration of the scheduling algorithms with the virtual lab
Reduction of manual work time by 100%

##Conclusion

The Virtual Lab for Scheduling Algorithms project was a success, and it provided a valuable tool for faculty and students to learn and understand scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The lab helped reduce manual work time and provided an efficient and streamlined process for scheduling tasks. The implementation of scheduling algorithms using C++ was a key component of the project, and the use of JavaScript and CSS helped create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the virtual lab.
